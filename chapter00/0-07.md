The program is invalid, as block comments, which can extend multiple lines, cannot be nested and are closed immediately when the first `*/` is encountered. Hence, the remaining part (`as its starting and ending delimters */`) of the comment is not rendered as a comment by the compiler, but instead rendered as a statement.
