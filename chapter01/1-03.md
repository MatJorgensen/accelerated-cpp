The program is valid, as the string `s` is not redeclared in the second definition, instead the string `s` is declared two times in two different scopes. The variable `s` is first defined when the program enters the first scope, however, when the program exits the first scope, the lifetime of defined variable `s` ends and the corresponding memory deallocated. Hence, when the program enters the second scope no variable `s` is defined.
