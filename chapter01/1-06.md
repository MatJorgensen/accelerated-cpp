Typing in two names, e.g. Samuel Beckett, stores both names in the buffer. When the program reaches the first `std::cin >> name;` statement the first name is flushed from the buffer, and when the program reaches the second `std::cin >> name;` statement the second (and at this point only) name in the buffer is flushed.
